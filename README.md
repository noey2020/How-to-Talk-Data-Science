Hire me! ðŸ˜Š

Congratulations! You got hired as a data scientist. In addition to your rainbow colors
of achievements and potential, you are empowered to deliver again. We want to use data
and follow the science. You are to do an end-to-end machine learning project.

Here are the main steps you will go through:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

Look at the Big Picture

Welcome to Machine Learning Election Debate Corporation. The first task you are asked to 
deliver is to build a model of people pulses. This data, which we have to construct in
the 65 days timeframe before the November 3 general elections, has metrics such as the
law & order, covid19 handling, economic recovery, religion, women's empowerment, criminal
reform, opportunity zones, China threat, Russia interference, Middle East peace, Durham 
probe, etc.

Frame the Problem

The first question to ask your boss is what exactly is the business objective; building a
model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit from
this model? This is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, what
algorithms you will select, what performance measure you will use to evaluate your model,
and how much effort you should spend tweaking it.

Your modelâ€™s output will be fed to another Machine Learning system, along with many other
signals. This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given
area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects events and revenues.

The next question to ask is what the current solution looks like (if any). It will often
give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem.

This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great.

Okay, with all this information you are now ready to start designing your system.
First, you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised, or Reinforcement
Learning? Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? Should
you use batch learning or online learning techniques?

Select a Performance Measure

Your next step is to select a performance measure. A typical performance measure for
regression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It gives an idea of how
much error the system typically makes in its predictions, with a higher weight for
large errors.

RMSE X, h = 1m
S i = 1
m
h x i - y i 2

...

Get the Data

Since we don't have data, we need to make random sampling. Methodology that doesn't 
oversamples and undersamples at the same time. Representative of real data.
